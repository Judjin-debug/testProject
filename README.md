### What case is solved
It's necessary to write a program that guesses a number

**Conditions:**
— Computer guesses a number from 0 to 100, and it's necessary to guess it. Guessing means writing an algorithm that does it.
— Algorithm considers whether the random number was less than the one it should guess.

**Metrics:**
Results are estimated by the mean average of 1000 tries.
